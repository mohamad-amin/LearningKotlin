# LearningKotlin
This is a simple Android application that shoes some weatehr data using [Open Weatehr Map API](openweathermap.org/api) built upon **Kotlin** language.
I created this project while reading [this](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book) book.

Most Kotlin concepts such as delegates, interfaces and ... are covered in this project. 
I also tried to develop this with Clean Architecture in mind but didn't spend much time on that so it's probably not a best practice.
